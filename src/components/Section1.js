      This is my second attempt since the first attempt I tried located <a target='_blank' rel="noreferrer" href='https://JonesPalmer.mwezn.repl.co'> at this url</a>
      was poorly desgined. 
      I made one major mistake by not designing it with mobile first principles! Hence why it doesnt scale images & font-sizes correctly</h2>
